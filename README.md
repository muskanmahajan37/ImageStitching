# Image and Video Stitching
This algorithm runs through a video file, or a set of images, and stitches them together to form a single image. It can be used for scanning in large documents where the resolution from a single photo may not be sufficient. Currently this doesnt take into account image blurring, evaluating whether an incoming frame has a better quality than the previous one, or lens undistortion.
